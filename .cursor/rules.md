# rules.md â€“ Orbit Patrimoine Project

## Objective
You are developing a web MVP for **Orbit Patrimoine**, a conversational assistant dedicated to individual real estate investors. The goal is to provide neutral, personalized support through a chat-based AI interface and a public documentation blog.

The website includes two main areas:
- A conversational AI chat interface (accessible after sign-up)
- A public blog that displays internal documentation (from local markdown files)

## MVP Features to Build
1. âœ… Chat interface powered by the OpenAI GPT-4 API
2. âœ… Authentication using Supabase (email/password)
3. ðŸš§ User profile creation form (goals, experience level, strategy)
4. ðŸš§ User dashboard page (accessible after login)
5. âœ… Blog rendering system using markdown files with categories
6. âœ… Basic SEO for the blog section

## Required Tech Stack
- Framework: **React with Vite** (with TypeScript) âœ…
- UI: **Tailwind CSS** (for responsive, modern styling) âœ…
- Backend & Auth: **Supabase** (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage) âœ…
- AI: **OpenAI GPT-4 API** via HTTPS POST ðŸš§
- Blog: uses `.mdx` files integrated in the React project âœ…
- Hosting: **Vercel or similar platform** âœ…

## Constraints
- Must be fully responsive (desktop and mobile) âœ…
- Code should be modular, clean, commented, and reusable âœ…
- No external CMS (blog content is fully local) âœ…
- Do not add external libraries unless explicitly requested âœ…
- The blog must not rely on a database (markdown files only) âœ…
- Prioritize performance and simplicity in the UX/UI âœ…
- Use TypeScript for all code files âœ…
- Properly handle client-side storage âœ…
- Implement robust error handling âœ…
- Code in English, but user interface in French âœ…

## Recommended File Structure
- `/src`: main source code âœ…
  - `/src/pages`: page components âœ…
  - `/src/components`: reusable UI components âœ…
    - `/src/components/ui`: basic UI components âœ…
  - `/src/hooks`: custom React hooks âœ…
  - `/src/context`: React contexts âœ…
  - `/src/lib`: utility functions (Supabase helpers, etc.) âœ…
  - `/src/types`: TypeScript type definitions âœ…
- `/public`: static assets âœ…
- `/.cursor`: Cursor configuration files âœ…

## Expected Best Practices
- Use clear, descriptive names for files and functions âœ…
- Document complex components âœ…
- Use modern React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, etc.) âœ…
- Build the foundation for future Premium features âœ…
- Use functional components with hooks rather than classes âœ…
- Implement local state management with `useState` and `useContext` âœ…
- Use strict TypeScript types for all components and functions âœ…
- Follow PascalCase naming convention for components and camelCase for functions âœ…
- Implement appropriate error handling with clear user messages âœ…
- Optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders âœ…
- Use loading components to improve UX during asynchronous operations âœ…

## Example Prompt to Use in AI Chat
> "You are an expert assistant in real estate investment strategy. You help users clarify their goals and better understand the steps of a rental property project. Here is the user profile: [user profile data]."

## Specific Development Rules
- **Authentication**: Use Supabase for authentication with session management âœ…
- **Route Management**: Protect authenticated routes with ProtectedRoute component âœ…
- **UI Components**: Create reusable and modular components âœ…
- **State Management**: Use custom hooks for business logic âœ…
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling with clear user messages âœ…
- **Performance**: Optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders âœ…
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the application is accessible to users with special needs âœ…
- **Testing**: Add tests for critical components and functions (to be implemented) ðŸš§
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation for complex components and functions âœ…
- **Internationalization**: Prepare the application for future internationalization (i18n) âœ…
- **Language**: Code in English, but user interface in French âœ…
